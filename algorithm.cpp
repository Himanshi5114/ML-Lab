When to use which algorithm:

1. Use Merge Sort when:

   - Stability is required
   - Dealing with linked lists

   - External sorting

​

2. Use Quick Sort when:

   - Average case performance is critical

   - In-place sorting is needed

   - Memory caching is important

​

3. Use Heap Sort when:

   - Guaranteed O(n log n) is needed

   - Memory usage must be minimized

   - Building a priority queue

​

4. Use Radix Sort when:

   - Sorting integers or strings

   - Keys have fixed length

   - Linear time sorting is needed
